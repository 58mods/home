At 58mods we build solutions for personal use or business purposes.

> Have you ever wanted a custom gaming computer or a home or office server bt could not achieve you goal because of the lack of equipment in Kenya. I have always had a dream of doing visual effects but that is impossible when there are no graphics cards I can build a custom pc with. And that's where 58mods was born!

At 58mods we build solutions like custom pcs for all purposes all the way from company servers to gaming and video editing workstations. The way we work is that you would contact us and specify us for what solution exactly you would like built for you. If you have the exacts specs of the system you would want you can mention them but if you don't know where you can start you just need to describe what you would need the solution for. You can be as detailed as you would like.

58mods will then reach out to you with a quote of the system you would like built as well as followup questions and suggestions. You will then need to pay half of the quoted price to get all the components and the rest can be paid after completion of the system.

At 58mods customer satisfaction is our priority. We will always put the customer first and ensure to provide our services as fast and as well as possible to the liking of the customer. Additionally we do maintenance of old systems and hardware upgrades to boost performance. Just reach out to us here:
